If there are enough, we could look at age gap differences between each group.\nI will then determine which gender is the oldest in each pair because I hypothesize that men will be older more of the time.\nI will start with these two questions for now and see where they take me\n\n\n\nMutate data\n\nClassifying sexuality of each couple\nHere I will create a new variable called sexuality based on whether each couple is of same or opposite gender, creating three labels for these relationships: straight (man & woman), gay (man & man), and sapphic (woman & woman)\nI will also look at how many observations there are for each sexuality.\n\nage_gaps_sexuality <- age_gaps %>% \n  mutate(sexuality = case_when(character_1_gender == 'man' & character_2_gender == 'woman' ~ 'straight',\n                               character_1_gender == 'man' & character_2_gender == 'man' ~ 'gay',\n                               character_1_gender == 'woman' & character_2_gender == 'woman' ~ 'sapphic',\n                               character_2_gender == 'man' & character_1_gender == 'woman' ~ 'straight',\n                               character_2_gender == 'man' & character_1_gender == 'man' ~ 'gay',\n                               character_2_gender == 'woman' & character_1_gender == 'woman' ~ 'sapphic'))\nsexuality_count <- age_gaps_sexuality %>% count(sexuality)\nsexuality_count <- sexuality_count %>% mutate(proportion = n/sum(n))\ntibble(sexuality_count)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  sexuality     n proportion\n  <chr>     <int>      <dbl>\n1 gay          12    0.0104 \n2 sapphic      11    0.00952\n3 straight   1132    0.980  \n\n\nHere, you see that 98% of couples in this data set can be defined as heterosexual.\n\n\nCounting how many times each gender is older than their partner\nHere, I will count the number of times each gender is older and then calculate that proportion.\n\nolder_count <- age_gaps %>% count(character_1_gender)\nolder_count <- older_count %>% mutate(proportion = n/sum(n))\ntibble(older_count)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  character_1_gender     n proportion\n  <chr>              <int>      <dbl>\n1 man                  941      0.815\n2 woman                214      0.185\n\n\nAs you can see here, men in Hollywood are much more likely to be older than their partner than women are. In this data set, men were older than their partner 80% of the time.\n\n\n\nData visualization\n\nDifference in average age gaps between straight, gay, and sapphic couples\n\nage_gaps_sexuality %>% ggplot(aes(sexuality, age_difference, color = sexuality)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight()\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that gay couples have a higher average age gap than other sexualities, but remember that they make up less than 1% of observations\n\n\nProportion of sexualities in couples throughout the years\n\nage_gaps_sexuality %>% ggplot(aes(y = couple_number, x = release_year, fill = sexuality)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Year Released\", breaks = seq(1930,2022,10)) +\n  ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight()\n\n\n\n\nOnly straight couples were documented in Hollywood prior to the 1990s. Queer couplings began to be documented in the 1990s and early 2000s, but still make up a small portion of couples which we saw earlier. We can also note that queer couplings started to pop up around the time that couple numbers in Hollywood dramatically increased in the late 1990s.\n\n\nDifference in age gaps between older men and women\n\nage_gaps %>% ggplot(aes(character_1_gender, age_difference, color = character_1_gender)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('#00C4D4', '#634490')) +\n   ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight()\n\n\n\n\nWithin Hollywood, older men tend to have a higher age gap with their partner than older women do.\n\n\nDifference in age gaps between younger men and women\n\nage_gaps %>% ggplot(aes(character_2_gender, age_difference, color = character_2_gender)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('#00C4D4', '#634490')) +\n   ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight()\n\n\n\n\nWithin Hollywood, younger men tend to have a smaller age gap with their partners compared to younger women who have a larger average age gap.\n\n\nLinear regression of age vs age gap between men and women\n\nage_gaps %>% ggplot(aes(actor_1_age, age_difference, color = character_1_gender)) +\n  stat_poly_line() +\n  stat_poly_eq() +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  scale_color_manual(name = \"Gender\", values = c('#00C4D4', '#634490')) +\n  ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight() +\n  labs(title = \"Linear model of older partner's age vs. relationship age gap\")\n\n\n\n\nMen in Hollywood who are older are more likely to have an increased age gap in their relationships as they age.\n\nage_gaps %>% ggplot(aes(actor_2_age, age_difference, color = character_2_gender)) +\n  stat_poly_line() +\n  stat_poly_eq() +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('#00C4D4', '#634490')) +\n  ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight() +\n  labs(title = \"Linear model of younger parter's age vs. relationship age gap\")\n\n\n\n\nWe do not see this same trend with the younger partners. There are less men who are younger than their partner, and there seems to be no indication that their age is a determining factor in their relationship age gap.\nThere are far more women who are younger than their partner, and overall it appears there are less women in couples past the age of 40, compared to the first scatter plot where men are in couples well past their 40s.\n\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\nWhat I learned from looking at this data of Hollywood couples on the same movie set:\n\n98% of documented couples were heterosexual\nMen were more likely to date someone younger than them then women were\nOlder men had a higher average age gap in their relationships, meaning they were more likely to date women much younger than them than older women were to date much younger men\nOlder partners of both genders showed an increase in relationship age gaps as their own age increased, although this was much more pronounced for men, meaning that as these men age, they continue to date young women\n\nFrom this data exploration, I have concluded that on average, men in Hollywood tend to date much younger women than themselves. They also continue to date much younger women as they age. I would also be interested in looking at the average age of all men recorded vs the average age of women because I have a feeling that men on average are older.\nTo conclude, and to quote Taylor Swift, “I’ll get older, but your lovers stay my age”."

The smoothed line helps visualize patterns in the plot.\n\n#produce scatter plot with smooth line; x = gdp, y = fertility\n#x-axis log transformed for gdp data\nggplot(gdpfert, aes(gdp, fertility))+\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth()+\n  scale_x_continuous(trans = \"log\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 637 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 637 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see a distinct negative correlation with fertility after the GDP of a country reaches above approx. 9.7 billion dollars.

The glm() function will be used to create a linear model for this scenario. The tidy() function from the broom package produces the summary of the model.\n\nfit3 <- glm(fertility ~ gdp + infant_mortality, data = africadata)\n\ntidy(fit3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n  term              estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n  <chr>                <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)       3.91e+ 0  5.49e- 2      71.2 0        \n2 gdp              -1.41e-11  9.62e-13     -14.7 1.45e- 46\n3 infant_mortality  2.18e- 2  4.99e- 4      43.6 4.58e-300\n\n\nBoth GDP and infant mortality has a statistically significant affect on fertility (p-values > 0.001). GDP has an extremely small negative effect on fertility (slope = -1.411e-11), and infant mortality has a small positive effect (slope = 2.176e-2)."

They also continue to date much younger women as they age. I would also be interested in looking at the average age of all men recorded vs the average age of women because I have a feeling that men on average are older.\nTo conclude, and to quote Taylor Swift, “I’ll get older, but your lovers stay my age”."
