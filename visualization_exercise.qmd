# Political donation data from FiveThirtyEight

Data is from the FiveThirtyEight article [Inside The Political Donation History Of Wealthy Sports Owners](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/inside-the-political-donation-history-of-wealthy-sports-owners/)

![](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/espn.DONATIONS.1028-2-1.png?w=1150)

## Load packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse) #for data cleaning
library(here) #for setting file paths
library(ggthemes) #for loading ggplot themes
library(skimr) #for skimming data sets
```

## Set figure size

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=10, fig.height=8) 
```

## Load data

You will see that the data set includes the following variables -\> `Owner`,`Team`,`League`, `Recipient`, `Amount`, `Election Year`, and `Party`

```{r}
here()
donation <- read_csv("data/sports-political-donations/sports-political-donations.csv")
skim(donation)
```

## Clean and wrangle data

These are the following steps I took to prepare the data.

1.  Filter for rows containing only the 6 leagues, leaving out ones that were cross-listed among many leagues. This removed a large amount of the data, meaning that a majority of team owners own multiple teams across various leagues.

2.  Filter for rows containing only democrat or republican, leaving out bipartisan donations. I would have left these in but I had issuing renaming all variations to just `bipartisan`.

3.  Parse the numerical values from `Amount` so it can then act as a numerical.

4.  Group by `League`, `Election Year`, and `Party`

5.  Sum the `Amount` of each group to find the total dollar amount of donations from each of the 6 leagues to each of the two parties in a given year.

6.  Ungroup. Data is now ready to plot.

```{r}
donation_clean <- donation %>% 
  filter(League ==c("MLB","NASCAR","NBA","NFL","NHL","WNBA")) %>% 
 
  filter(Party ==c("Democrat","Republican")) %>% 
  
  mutate(Amount = parse_number(Amount)) %>% 
  
  group_by(League,`Election Year`,Party) %>% 
  
  summarise(party_donations = sum(Amount)) %>% 
  
  ungroup() 

skim(donation_clean)
```

## Plot data

```{r}
donation_plot <- donation_clean %>%
ggplot(aes(fill=Party, y=party_donations, x=`Election Year`)) +

  geom_bar(position = "fill", stat = "identity", color = "white") + #basic geometry of plot, bar plot

  facet_wrap(as.factor(donation_clean$League)) + #plot by individual League

  scale_fill_manual(name="DONATIONS TO", values=c("#00A5E3", "#CC0000"), #looked up hexcodes on google 
  labels=c("DEMOCRATS","REPUBLICANS")) + #fill colors in correct order

  theme_fivethirtyeight() + #theme from fivethirtyeight website

  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2016,2020,2)) + #2 year breaks between 2016 & 2020

  labs(title = "Across leagues, majority of donations go to Republicans",
  subtitle = "Share of donations from team owners in six leagues, per year, league and party") +

  theme(legend.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16),
  legend.text = element_text(size = 16),
  plot.title.position = "plot",
  plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 24),
  plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 18),
  legend.position = "top",
  axis.text.x = element_text(size = 14))
  donation_plot
```

You will notice that the proportions on my plot are slightly different from the original. This is because I excluded all cross-listed league affiliations (for the sake of time, but in the future I would like to be able to parse these out into individual observations). I also excluded bipartisan donations and NAs because I was having trouble renaming these all to `bipartisan`. I would also like to work on this, as I would like to be able to re-create this chart more accurately.

I also had some formatting issues that I couldn't quite work out on my own. For one, I could not figure out how to change the size of the facet labels. I also struggled to find a way to change the y-axis tick labels to be percentages like on the original.
