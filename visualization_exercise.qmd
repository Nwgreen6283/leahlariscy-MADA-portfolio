# Data is from a FiveThirtyEight article [Inside The Political Donation History Of Wealthy Sports Owners](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/inside-the-political-donation-history-of-wealthy-sports-owners/)

## Here is their plot:

![](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/espn.DONATIONS.1028-2-1.png?w=1150)

## Load packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(ggthemes)
```

## Set figure size

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=10, fig.height=8) 
```

## Load data

```{r}
here()
donation <- read_csv("data/sports-political-donations/sports-political-donations.csv")
donation
```

## Clean and wrangle data

```{r}
donation_clean <- donation %>% 
  filter(League ==c("MLB","NASCAR","NBA","NFL","NHL","WNBA")) %>%
  filter(Party ==c("Democrat","Republican")) %>% 
  mutate(Amount = parse_number(Amount)) %>% 
  group_by(League,`Election Year`,Party) %>% 
  summarise(party_donations = sum(Amount)) %>% 
  ungroup() 
```

## Plot data

```{r}
donation_plot <- donation_clean %>%
ggplot(aes(fill=Party, y=party_donations, x=`Election Year`)) +
geom_bar(position = "fill", stat = "identity", color = "white") +
facet_wrap(as.factor(donation_clean$League)) + #plot by League
scale_fill_manual(name="DONATIONS TO", values=c("#00A5E3", "#CC0000"), #looked up hexcodes on google
labels=c("DEMOCRATS","REPUBLICANS")) + #fill colors in correct order
theme_fivethirtyeight() +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2016,2020,2)) + #2 year breaks between 2016 & 2020
labs(title = "Across leagues, majority of donations go to Republicans",
subtitle = "Share of donations from team owners in six leagues, per year, league and party") +
theme(legend.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16),
legend.text = element_text(size = 16),
plot.title.position = "plot",
plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 24),
plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 18),
legend.position = "top",
axis.text.x = element_text(size = 14))
donation_plot
```

Because I had to remove some data, my plot looks slightly different but still similar.
