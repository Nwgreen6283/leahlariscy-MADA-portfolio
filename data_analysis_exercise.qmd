## Data description 

Data was accessed from the Bacteria, Enterics, Amoeba, and Mycotics (BEAM) Dashboard, which houses data collected by the System for Enteric Disease Response, Investigation, and Coordination (SEDRIC).

```{r}
beam_raw <- read_csv("data/raw_data/BEAM_Dashboard_Report_Data.csv")
```

## Data cleaning 

Begin by combining the `Year` and `Month` variables into one variable `Date`, then select for variables of interest and rename them.

```{r}
beam_clean <- beam_raw %>% mutate(date = make_date(year = Year, month = Month, day = 1)) %>% select(c(date, state=State, source=Source, pathogen=Pathogen, species=`Serotype/Species`, num_isolates=Number_of_isolates))
print(beam_raw)
```
